Overview
========

Abscissa is a domain specific language for generating 2D plots. Abscissa is
embedded in Chicken Scheme. Gnuplot is used as the plotting engine. See
http://bsilbaugh.github.io/chicken-abscissa for more information and
examples.

Status
======

Abscissa is quite usable at this point for basic plotting tasks. However,
breaking changes may occur, and there may still be critical bugs.
