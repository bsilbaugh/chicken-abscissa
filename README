Overview
========

Abscissa is a domain specific language for generating 2D plots. Abscissa is
embedded in Chicken Scheme. Gnuplot is used as the plotting engine. 

Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples should provide a basic sense of how Abscissa is
used. For more examples, see the examples directory in the source tree. 

Example 1: Single data set
--------------------------

Suppose xy is a list of pairs; e.g.

    (define xy '((0 . 0) (1 . 1) (2 . 4) (3 . 9)))

Then the following would create an interactive window containing a line
plot of xy

    ([window]
     ([figure]
      ([cartesian]
       ([line] (<- xy)))))

Note that the indentation used above is not significant: it is only used 
for readability.

Example 2: Multiple data set
----------------------------

Suppose xy and pq are lists of pairs; e.g.

    (define xy '((0 . 0.0) (1 . 1.0) (2 . 4.0) (3 . 9.0)))

    (define pq '((0 . 0.1) (1 . 0.9) (2 . 4.1) (3 . 8.9)))

Then the following would create an interactive window with the xy values
represented by lines and pq values represented by symbols

    ([window]
     ([figure]
      ([cartesian]
       ([line] (<- xy))
       ([points] (<- pq)))))

Example 3: Configuring Plot Elements
------------------------------------

Suppose xy is a list of pairs; e.g.

    (define xy '((0 . 0) (1 . 1) (2 . 4) (3 . 9)))

Then the following would create an interactive window with xy values
represented by blue line segments, the x axis limits set to [0,1]

    ([window]
     ([figure]
      ([cartesian x-limits: '(0.0 . 1.0)]
       ([line color: "dark-blue"] (<- xy)))))

Status
======

Abscissa is quite usable at this point for basic plotting tasks. However,
breaking changes may occur, and there may still be critical bugs.

Installation
============

Latest "Stable" Release
-----------------------

Abscissa has not yet been formally released. You may, however, install a
development snapshot; see Latest Development Version section.

Latest Development Version
--------------------------

1. Clone the git repository on github; e.g.

       git clone https://github.com/bsilbaugh/chicken-abscissa.git

2. Change the current working directory to the directory of the cloned
   repository; e.g.

       cd chicken-abscissa

3. Compile and install using the chicken-install program; e.g.

       chicken-install

  or

      chicken-install -sudo

  if you're egg repository requires super user privileges. Also see the
  Chicken Scheme User Manual and Wiki for additional installation options.
