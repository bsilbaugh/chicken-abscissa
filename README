Overview
========

Abscissa is a small embedded domain specific language for generating 2D
plots. The parent language is Chicken Scheme. Gnuplot is used as the
underlying plotting engine.

Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EXAMPLE 1: Single Data Set
--------------------------

Suppose xy-pairs is a list of x y pairs; e.g

    (define xy-pairs '((0.1 . 0.2) (0.2 . 0.4) (0.3 . 0.9)))

Then, the following would generate a PDF file of a 2D line plot

    (pdf-file (figure (cartesian (lines (data-pairs xy-pairs)))))

EXAMPLE 2: Multiple Data Sets
-----------------------------

 Suppose xy-pairs and rs-pairs are lists of x y pairs; e.g

    (define xy-pairs '((0.10 . 0.20) (0.20 . 0.40) (0.30 . 0.90)))

    (define rs-pairs '((0.10 . 0.20) (0.15 . 0.30) (0.20 . 0.40) 
                       (0.25 . 0.75) (0.30 . 0.90) (0.35 . 1.00)))

Then, the following would generate a PDF file of a 2D plot with xy-pairs
points joined by line segments and rs-pairs points represented by symbols.
    
    (pdf-file (figure (cartesian (lines  (data-pairs xy-pairs)) 
                                 (points (data-pairs rs-points)))))

Status
======

Abscissa currently exists as a rough proof-of-concept. Many breaking
changes are likely to occur. There may be critical bugs.

Critical missing features:

* Configuration of graph properties

Installation
============

Latest "Stable" Release
-----------------------

Abscissa has not yet been formally released. You may, however, install a
development snapshot; see Latest Development Version section.

Latest Development Version
--------------------------

1. Clone the git repository on github; e.g.

       git clone https://github.com/bsilbaugh/chicken-abscissa.git

2. Change the current working directory to the directory of the cloned
   repository; e.g.

       cd chicken-abscissa

3. Compile and install using the chicken-install program; e.g.

       chicken-install

  or

      chicken-install -sudo

  if you're egg repository requires super user privileges. Also see the
  Chicken Scheme User Manual and Wiki for additional installation options.

Language Specification
======================

The languge specification is a work in progress and may be out of
date/sync with the implementation.

DATA SETS:

    (data-pairs <list of pairs>) => <data set>

    (data-vectors <list of ordinate values> <list of abscissa values>) => <data set>

DATA SET GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION:

    (lines <data set>) => <data graphic>

    (points <data set>) => <data graphic>

    (lines-points <data set>) => <data graphic>

AXES:

    (cartesian <data graphic> ...) => <axes>

    (polar <data graphic> ...) => <axes>

FIGURES:

     (figure <axes> ...) => <figure graphic>

RENDERING:

    (pdf-file <figure graphic>) => generates PDF file

    (svg-file <figure graphic>) => generates SVG file

    (png-file <figure graphic>) => generates png file

    (window <figure graphic>) => sends graphic to display window    

Misc Questions and Answers
==========================

Why yet another plotting library?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was interested in using Scheme for some data processing tasks, and I
couldn't find a plotting package that I liked. Plus, this provides an
opportunity to sharpen my Scheme programming skills and learn a little
about language design.

Why use Gnuplot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main reasons are:

* I'm already familiar with it.

* It is readily available.

* It is easy to wrap (using pipes).

* It can be used to generate decent looking plots.

That said, there may be some better alternatives out there. (I'm open to
suggestions.)

Why a descriptive language?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A descriptive language enables a person to describe the desired graphical
representation in terms of a given data set. Descriptive languages are
*static* in nature; i.e. there are no verbs. This contrasts with
conventional plotting API's (and scripting languages) that require a person
to indirectly specify the desired graphical result by specifying a sequence
of actions. Conventional API's require a person to think in terms of a
*dynamic* process. All other things being equal, it is easier for humans to
describe what they want rather than how to create it.
